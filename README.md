- The motivation to create this application was to build of my previous knowledge of Java script and to practice my new knowledge of web api

- I build to project to challenge my self to use the resources available to me to create an complete and interactive web page.

- The project solves the problem of not having a method by which to quiz oneself.

- What i learned from the project is how to use web api to locally store data, use event listeners, use interval functions, use JSON, and other java script and web api tools.
